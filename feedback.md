#### 1) Project Planning

A project consists of more than just code.

This project requires **planning** organized within a **Trello board** with the following **lists**:

-[x] **Icebox**: Holds user stories that have yet to be moved to the _Current/MVP_ list. All user stories are originally put into the _Icebox_, including both MVP and wish list stories.

-[x] **Current/MVP**: Holds user stories that must be completed to meet the minimum project requirements (MVP). Once the MVP has been met, additional user stories may be moved from the _Icebox_.

-[x] **Completed**: Hold completed user stories.

-[x] **Wireframes**: Sketches of each screens's user interface for the major functionality of the application.

-[x] **Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD)**: A diagram of the app's models (one per data entity) and the relationships between them.

> User stories need to be formed properly using this template:<br>`As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>`. The _reason_ is optional if it's patently obvious.

#### 2) Project Source Control & README

The project must include a **`README.md`** file with the following sections:

-[x] **Introduction**: A paragraph used to introduce interested parties to the project and needs to include one or more screenshots.

-[x] **Technologies Used**: A list of all technologies, libraries, APIs, etc. used in the project.

-[x] **Getting Started**: Links to the project's planning (Trello board) and the **deployed app** on Heroku.

-[x] **Unsolved Problems**: List any unsolved issues.

-[x] **Future Enhancements**: Identify future features and enhancements planned for the project.

#### 3) Application Technical Requirements/Deliverables

-[x] A **working** full-stack, single-page application hosted on Heroku.

-[x] Incorporate the technologies of the **MERN-stack**: - MongoDB/Mongoose - Express - React - Node

-[x] **Have a well-styled interactive front-end** that communicates with the **Express** backend via AJAX.

-[x] Implement token-based **authentication**. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out.

-[x] Implement **authorization** by restricting CUD data functionality to appropriately authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.

-[x] **Have a comprehensive feature-set**. For example, **if the app does not include full-CRUD** data operations, **ensure the addition** of one or more of the following: - Consume a third-party API. - Utilize multi-user, real-time communications. - Include _admin_ features.

#### 4) Project Feedback

I first want to start off by saying, you really pulled it together those last few hours for presentation day. All in all I think you need to do a better job managing your expectations of yourself, and not to take things so personally or hard. A lot of the things we discuss like managing time, and limiting project scope will take you further than you realize. I think this project is a great example. We understood you really wanted to use an API, however that didn't work out as planned. Your application would have had that much more functionality provided you would have had that time back to work on it. Third party APIs can be nice, however they can be hard to use, as you saw, for various reasons. I think you did come away with an understanding of React, and how it works with an custom express/node API. I think you are in a super great spot with your project to flush out some more depth. The characters render, and they do save to the database. Once you add some more styles add another feature or two, you will have a great project to demonstrate your knowledge of modern javascript. Keep up the grind!
